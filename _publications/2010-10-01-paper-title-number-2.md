The formation and evolution of Mercury’s large metallic core is poorly understood. Based on the evolution of the melting temperature as a function of pressure in the Fe-S system, a top-down crystallization processes (iron “snow”) has been suggested, which does not occur in larger terrestrial planets like the Earth. In order to test this atypical process in a system that is likely to be closer to a natural core composition, we recently constrained the eutectic melting temperature in the Fe-FeS-Fe3C system, which we found to be very low (800-900°C) between 4.5 and 24 GPa. Recent results from the MESSENGER mission indicate extremely reducing conditions in Mercury, under which a substantial amount of silicon should also dissolve into the core. The presence of Si could significantly modify the chemical and physical properties of Mercury’s core (e.g., phase relations, crystallization, and density).
