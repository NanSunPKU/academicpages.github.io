title: "Age and Tectonic Setting of the Aoyougou-Erzhihaladaban Ophiolite in the Western North Qilian Mountains, NW China"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'The Aoyougou-Erzhihaladaban ophiolite is one of the representativeophiolite fragments in the west sector of the North Qilian orogenic belt. Usingsensitive high resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP), two samples from this areawere dated. A fine-grained gabbro sample from the Aoyougou section hasconsistent apparent Pb/U ages in the range of 490 to 508 Ma with aweighted mean age of 501 ± 4 Ma (MSWD=1.09), whereas a dolerite samplefrom the Erzhihaladaban section has a relatively younger Pb/U age of495±4 Ma (MSWD=0.98). Combined with detailed field examination, mineral and whole-rock chemical study, we conclude that the exposed Aoyougou-Erzhihaladaban ophiolite represents a part of the dismembered North Qianlian oceanic crust of the era. In addition, the authors propose that the voluminousbasalts interstratified with carbonates and mudstones of the Neo-Proterozoic Zhulongguan group do not belong to the Aoyougou-Erzhihaladaban ophiolite.Instead, they may be continental flood basalts formed as a result of break-up of the Rodinia supercontinent.'
